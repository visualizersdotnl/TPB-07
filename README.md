TPB-07 PC demo planned for approx. late February or March 2020

About this whole licensing deal: I picked MIT but feel free to regard all of this as public domain.
You might find different licensing details in the shaders or elsewhere: ignore it :)

You are however not allowed to rip any of this off for your "art installations", you'll receive a firm beating if we ever find out!
