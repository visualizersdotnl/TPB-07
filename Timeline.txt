Timeline 

- Loading screen is white with in the lower left corner Nytrik's logo
- Show Excess logo while Chael rants, and garble logo
- On start of beats, show blobs with credits:
   + Re-introducing Superplek
   + Additional programming: Trevor, Ravity
   + Audio: Dascon
   + Graphics: Alien, Nytrik
   + Introducing Chael Sonnen
- Slowly fade in TPB t-shirt logo during break (maybe pitch sales!)
- Flash back and forth between castle chains part (flashes of it) and the cracktro part in which you greet groups
- When the music ends come to a stand still, "We're not surprised, motherfuckers!"

+ We still have that sweet burning Orange-style effect to spare.
